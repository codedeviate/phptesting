# PHP CLI Testing
```diff
- THIS IS A TEST PROJECT NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE.
```

A testing environment for CLI on most of the recent php versions and some older onces as well.

It also provides an external port so that browser testing can be done as well.

The internal port is 80 for all sub environments. Respective external port can be found [here](#exposed-ports)

## package.json???
Just to mess with some purists we've used npm.

## Supported PHP versions
The support for PHP in the different version are at the moment basic but will be extended to a useful level.

### PHP 8.2
### PHP 8.1
### PHP 8.0
### PHP 7.4
### PHP 7.3
### PHP 7.2
### PHP 7.1
### PHP 7.0 
### PHP 5.6

## Versions in progress
### PHP 5.5
This version has not all modules added yet.

It runs and answers on the exposed port but lacks some features.

## Not yet supported

### PHP versions
* PHP 5.4
* PHP 5.3
* PHP 5.2
* PHP 5.1
* PHP 5.0

Which version will be supported is more of a work in progress. The list is to be considered a wish list.

## Exposed ports
Each PHP service has a port exposed. The port used is 10000 plus the PHP version multipled by 100. (The first attempt on this was to multiply by 10. But then PHP 8.0 would have the port 10080 and that port is considered unsafe by browsers.)

| Version | Port  |
| ------- | ----- |
| 8.2     | 10820 |
| 8.1     | 10810 |
| 8.0     | 10800 |
| 7.4     | 10740 |
| 7.3     | 10730 |
| 7.1     | 10710 |
| 7.0     | 10700 |
| 5.6     | 10560 |
| 5.5     | 10550 |

## Used and alternative distributions
All versions are based on official PHP docker images with an Alpine distribution.

PHP 8.2, PHP 8.1, PHP 8.0 and PHP 7.4 each have a Dockerfile that uses the standard distribution used by PHP (Debian based) that can be used by altering *docker-composer.yml*.

PHP 5.5 and earlier doesn't have any official docker images based on Alpine. We might add these later.
